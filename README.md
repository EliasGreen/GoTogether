GoTogether [Geolocation Web App]
=================================
finished -> 09.04.2018

ABOUT:
This app supposed to do:
1). Get GeoLocation of registered user
2). Send to users all markers created by other users with custom icons, comments and GEOloc
3). If current user want => is able to write to another user to jogging/cooking/swimming together or post own request to find a partner for dinner (for example)

BUT!:
This app do not do all this stuff because it's "application for learning new skills"
So I wrote only the things that I didn't do before [features].

Features:
- loading imgs /avatars of users/ using base64 encoding into MongoDB [only vanilla JS]
- google maps API [+ custom marker's icons]
